## Overview

**Stock Analyst Jr.** is a Java-based financial analytics system designed to ingest, process, and model historical stock market data.  
It leverages **machine learning**, **statistical modeling**, and **feature engineering** techniques to forecast price movements and generate actionable insights.

The project demonstrates a complete **data-to-decision pipeline** — from data acquisition and storage, to feature generation, model training, and evaluation.

The main goals include:
- Building a modular ETL and analytics pipeline  
- Integrating predictive models (ML / statistical)  
- Storing processed and forecasted data in **PostgreSQL**  
- Providing reproducible analysis through configurable runs  

---

## Architecture / Tech Stack

- **Java (JDK 17+)** – Core programming language  
- **PostgreSQL** – Persistent storage for historical and modeled data  
- **Maven** – Build automation and dependency management  
- **Git** – Version control  
- **APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance / Alpha Vantage)** – Data sources  
- *(Planned)* **Python/R Integration** – For advanced model prototyping  

## Usage

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 17 or later (`java --version`)
- Maven (`mvn -v`)
- PostgreSQL (`psql --version`)
- Git (`git --version`)

### Build
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbElo-77/Stock-Analyst-Jr..git
cd Stock-Analyst-Jr.
mvn clean install
```

### Run
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE stock_analyst;
CREATE USER analyst_user WITH PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE stock_analyst TO analyst_user;
```

```bash 
java -jar target/StockAnalystJr.jar
```
